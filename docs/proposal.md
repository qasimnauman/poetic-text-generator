# Poetic Text Generator â€“ Proposal

## Problem Statement

Creative writing often requires inspiration and linguistic flair. Many aspiring writers and poets struggle to find the right words or style to begin or continue a poem. This project aims to automate the generation of poetry using AI models trained on classical literary datasets.

## Objectives

- Generate coherent poetic verses mimicking classical styles.
- Provide configurable parameters (length, temperature) to control output.
- Evaluate generated poetry based on word diversity and user-defined fitness.

## Chosen Techniques

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM layers.
- Use of character-level language modeling.
- Fitness scoring based on vocabulary diversity and structure.

## Expected Outcomes

- A functional API to generate poetry.
- A web interface (optional) or CLI for end-user interaction.
- Evaluation metrics and sample outputs for performance testing.
